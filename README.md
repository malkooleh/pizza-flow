# 🍕 PizzaFlow: Cloud-Native Pizzeria Ecosystem

## 📖 Overview

**PizzaFlow** is a high-performance, event-driven ecosystem designed to manage multi-location pizzeria chains. This project serves as a showcase for building scalable, resilient systems using **Java 21**, **Spring Boot 3.4**, and modern cloud-native patterns.

The system handles the entire lifecycle of a pizza—from inventory management and customer booking to smart kitchen queuing and delivery logistics.

## 🏗️ Architecture

PizzaFlow follows an **Event-Driven Microservices** architecture to ensure loose coupling and high availability.

### System Landscape

* **Infrastructure Suite:** 
* *Service Discovery (Eureka):* Dynamic service registration.
* *Config Server:* Centralized, environment-specific configurations.
* *API Gateway:* Single entry point with rate limiting and routing.


* **Core Domains:**
* **Catalog & Inventory:** Real-time ingredient tracking and menu management.
* **Sales (Order/Payment/Booking):** Transactional integrity for diverse order types.
* **Operations (Kitchen/Delivery):** Smart dispatching and queue optimization.


* **Cross-cutting Concerns:**
* **Notification Service:** Real-time updates via WebSockets/Email.
* **Audit Log:** Comprehensive tracking of all critical system mutations.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Virtual Threads (Project Loom):** Optimized for high-concurrency I/O operations without the overhead of traditional platform threads.
* **Event-Driven Communication:** Utilizing **Apache Kafka** for reliable asynchronous data flow between domains.
* **High-Performance RPC:** **gRPC** implemented for low-latency synchronous internal service calls.
* **Intelligent Kitchen Distribution:** Algorithms to balance workload across multiple restaurant locations.
* **Identity Management:** Integrated with **Keycloak** for OAuth2/OIDC, supporting Role-Based and Attribute-Based Access Control (RBAC/ABAC).
